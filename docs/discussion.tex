\section{Discussion of Results}

The results of the study show that the adjusted H-Indexes are significantly
correlated with the traditional H-Index, with correlation coefficients in the
range of 0.6 to 0.7. This indicates a strong positive relationship between
them, suggesting that researchers who rank highly according to the traditional
H-Index also tend to rank highly according to the adjusted H-Indexes.

However, compared to other H-Index variants, as reviewed in the literature, the
correlation is not perfect. This imperfection highlights the distinctiveness of
the adjusted H-Indexes. While the strong correlation signifies that they retain
the fundamental characteristics of the traditional H-Index, the differences
suggest that the adjustments made for journal quality and subject specificity
introduce meaningful variations. These variations likely reflect the impact of
publishing in higher-quality journals and the influence of subject-specific
citation practices, which are not captured by the normal H-Index. In addition
to that, the adjusted H-Indexes decrease the number of authors with high
H-Indexes compared to the traditional metric, resulting in a deflation of
H-Index values. This adjustment potentially offers a more accurate
representation of the authors' impact, which is evident from the reduction in
the number of authors with H-Indexes above certain thresholds, as shown in
Table \ref{tab:thresholds}.

The analysis of citation practices reveals substantial differences between
authors publishing in lower-tier journals and those publishing in top-tier
ones. Authors from lower-tier journals have a lower median average h-index of
cited journals compared to random authors from top-tier journals, suggesting
that they cite less influential or lower-quality research. This pattern is
consistent across almost all subject areas, emphasizing the importance of
journal quality in citation practices and the impact on the overall scholarly
contribution of authors.

Furthermore, the citation network clustering analysis highlights that top
authors are more likely to be part of tightly-knit citation clusters. This
interconnectedness is particularly pronounced in fields like Physical Sciences
and Multidisciplinary research, where collaboration is more prevalent. The
higher clustering coefficients for top authors suggest that these authors are
more engaged in collaborative research and are part of a more cohesive
community, which may contribute to their higher h-index values.

These findings emphasize the need for incorporating journal quality and the
need for considering subject-specific citation network structures into
bibliometric evaluations. By doing so, we can achieve a more accurate and
comprehensive assessment of a researcher's true impact, beyond what the
traditional H-Index alone can offer. This approach helps to mitigate issues
such as H-Index inflation and not accounting for the quality of the journals in
which researchers publish, thus providing a clearer picture of academic
contributions overall.

\section{Implications for Researchers and Practitioners}

The findings of this study have several implications for researchers and
practitioners in the field of bibliometrics and research evaluation. First,
researchers should be aware of the limitations of H-Index metrics and consider
the impact of journal quality on such metrics. By focusing on publishing in
reputable journals with high impact factor, eigenfactor and h-index values,
researchers can enhance the visibility and recognition of their work, leading
to a more accurate assessment of their impact.

Practitioners involved in research evaluation and funding decisions should also
take into account the quality of the journals in which researchers publish when
assessing their achievements. Researchers can adjust the threshold of the
journal quality metrics, such as modifying the percentile of the rankings that
is considered for top journals (10\% or 30\%), to further refine the adjusted
H-Indexes. This allows them to tailor the metrics to their specific research
field, based on the desired strictness in evaluating journal quality. By
incorporating metrics that consider the journal quality of publications into
evaluation criteria, practitioners can ensure a more meaningful evaluation of
researchers' contributions to their field.

Additionally, the study highlights the need for further research into more
advanced H-Index variants that address issues such as self-citation and
hyperauthorship. By developing more sophisticated yet straightforward H-Index
metrics, practitioners can enhance the accuracy and fairness of bibliometric
evaluations.

Lastly, the study showcases a methodological approach for evaluating metrics
that incorporate journal quality and subject specificity into the calculation
of H-Indexes. Specifically, by using the Alexandria3k package to extract and
analyze publication data from the Crossref-2024 dataset, along with the
effective use of ROLAP analysis and unit testing, the study demonstrates a
reliable method for calculating and analyzing efficiently and accurately
adjusted H-Indexes. By adopting similar methodologies, researchers can enhance
the robustness and validity of their evaluations.

Overall, the study contributes to the ongoing discussion on the limitations of
traditional H-Index metrics and provides a more nuanced and accurate assessment
of scholarly impact. By addressing these limitations and providing insights
into citation practices and patterns across different subject areas, the study
contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of research evaluation,
ultimately benefiting researchers, practitioners, and policymakers involved in
academic assessments and funding decisions.
