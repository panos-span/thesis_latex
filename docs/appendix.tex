The scripts that were produced for the calculation of the metrics and the
analysis of the results are available in the following GitHub repository:

}

The full dependency graph of the h index calculations can be seen
in Figure \ref{fig:dependency_graph_h5}.

Additionally, the full dependency graph of the h index calculations can be seen
in Figure \ref{fig:dependency_graph_jif}.
