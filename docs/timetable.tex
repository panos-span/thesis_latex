\chapter{Updated Project Timetable}
\label{ch:timetable}

My internship at EY started on March 19th, 2019 and was completed on June 18th,
2024. The time duration of all activities described in \ref{tab:timetable} is
depicted in the following timetable. Important to note is that the timetable
does not account for the times when any revisions or modifications were needed
to be made to any of the activities, such as the data collection and
preprocessing activity, which required additional time and attention after
their initial completion, due to unforeseen issues and challenges that arose
later.
