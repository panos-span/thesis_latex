\label{ch:skills}

During my internship at EY, I acquired a variety of skills that were essential
for the successful completion of the project. These skills were developed
through the completion of various tasks and activities, such as data
collection, exploratory data analysis, model development, and project
management. The following table provides an overview of the skills I acquired
during my internship, along with the related methods and examples of their
application \ref{tab:skills_acquired}.
