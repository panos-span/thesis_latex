\section{Background and Motivation}
In the realm of academic research, evaluating the impact and contribution of
scholars is pivotal for numerous purposes, including tenure decisions, grant
allocations, and academic promotions. One of the most widely used metrics for
this evaluation is the H-Index, which aims to measure both the productivity and
citation impact of a scholar’s publications. Despite its widespread adoption,
the H-Index has been critiqued for several limitations, particularly its
susceptibility to inflation through the inclusion of lower-quality publications
\cite{costas2007h, tonta2020monetary}.

According to Hirsch, a scientist has an index \( h \) if \( h \) of his or her
\( N_p \) papers have at least \( h \) citations each, and the other \( (N_p -
h) \) papers have \(\leq h \) citations each.

\[
      \text{H-Index} = \max \left( h : \text{there are at least } h \text{ papers with } h \text{ or more citations each} \right)
\]

Formally, for a given researcher with \( N_p \) papers, the H-Index \( h \) is
defined as:

\[
      h = \max \left\{ h \, \Bigg| \, \sum_{i=1}^{N_p} \mathbf{1} (c_i \geq h) \geq h \right\}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
      \item \( N_p \) is the total number of papers,
      \item \( c_i \) is the number of citations for the \( i \)-th paper,
      \item \( \mathbf{1}(\cdot) \) is the indicator function, which is 1 if the condition inside is true and 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize} In simpler terms, the H-Index is defined as the maximum value of h
such that the given author has published h papers that have each been cited at least h times \cite{hirsch2005index}.
While straightforward, this metric does not account for the quality of the journals where
these papers are published. Consequently, an author could achieve a high H-Index
by publishing numerous papers in lower-impact journals, potentially inflating their perceived impact \cite{tonta2020monetary}.

This inflation problem becomes particularly problematic in interdisciplinary
fields where the impact and quality of journals can vary significantly across
different subjects \cite{hirsch2005index,waltman2012inconsistency}. Therefore,
there is a pressing need to refine the H-Index by incorporating metrics that
reflect journal quality and subject specificity. Addressing these limitations
could enhance the accuracy and fairness of academic evaluations, ensuring that
the metric truly reflects the scholarly impact of researchers.

%\section{Problem Statement}
%The traditional H-Index has notable limitations affecting its reliability and
%accuracy as a measure of scholarly impact. Primarily, as mentioned, it fails to
%differentiate between the quality of journals where papers are published,
%allowing authors to achieve high H-Indexes through publications in
%lower-quality journals, thereby inflating their perceived impact
%\cite{costas2007h,tonta2020monetary}. This issue is exacerbated in
%interdisciplinary research, where measured journal quality can vary widely
%across different subjects, due to variations in citation practices
%\cite{costas2007h,norris2010h}.
%
%Specifically, H-Index inflation occurs when researchers achieve higher H-Index
%values not necessarily through impactful research but through strategic
%publication practices. These practices may include targeting journals with
%lower standards, which can increase the number of published papers and
%citations without corresponding increases in the quality of research, practice
%that distorts the assessment of academic influence and undermines the
%credibility of bibliometric evaluations \cite{tonta2020monetary}.
%
%Another critical limitation of the traditional H-Index is its susceptibility to
%self-citations and collaborative publications. Researchers may engage in
%self-citation practices to boost their citation counts, which directly impacts
%their H-Index
%\cite{hirsch2005index,schreiber2008share,costas2007h,waltman2012inconsistency,norris2010h,bartneck2011detecting,zhivotovsky2008self}.
%Similarly, in fields with high levels of collaboration, the H-Index may be
%inflated as it does not account for the fractional contribution of each author
%in multi-authored papers along with the citation practices of the authors
%\cite{schreiber2008share,costas2007h,waltman2012inconsistency,norris2010h,zhivotovsky2008self}.
%These factors can lead to significant disparities in H-Index values that do not
%accurately reflect individual researchers' contributions and impact.
%
%To address such issues, this thesis proposes developing and evaluating H-Index
%calculations that incorporate subject-specific journal rankings based on
%H5-Index and impact factor. By focusing on the top 20\% of journals within each
%subject area, the goal is to create a more accurate and meaningful metric that
%reflects both the productivity and the quality of an author's research
%contributions.
%
%\section{Objectives of the Thesis}
%The primary objective of this thesis is to develop and validate H-Index
%calculations that incorporate journal quality through subject-specific
%rankings. The specific objectives are as follows:
%\begin{enumerate}
%      \item \textbf{Develop H-Index Metrics:} Create three H-Index metrics that incorporate journal quality
%            by using subject-specific rankings based on H5-Index, Journal Impact Factor (JIF) and Eigenfactor (EF).
%            This involves selecting the top 20\% of journals within each subject area and calculating the H-Index based on publications
%            in these high-quality journals.
%            %\item \textbf{Evaluate the Impact of Journal Quality:} Analyze how incorporating journal quality affects the H-Index calculation.
%            %      This includes comparing the traditional H-Index with the proposed H-Indexes to determine the extent to which the latter
%            %      provide a more accurate representation of a scholar’s impact.
%      \item \textbf{Assess Correlation Between Traditional H-Index and Proposed H-Indexes:} Assess the correlation between the traditional H-Index
%            and the proposed H-Indexes. This involves statistical analysis by rank order correlation
%            to evaluate the consistency and divergence in author rankings when different criteria for journal quality are applied.
%      \item \textbf{Analyze Citation Practices and conduct Network Analysis of Citation Patterns:} Analyze citation practices of authors publishing in high and low-ranked journals
%            and examine the citation graphs of highly ranked authors versus regular authors based on their publications within their specific subjects,
%            for each ranking method (H5, JIF, EF), focusing on network characteristics such as
%            clustering coefficients.
%            %\item \textbf{Compare Citation Behaviors Across Journal Quality:} Compare citation behaviors and network characteristics
%            %      of authors publishing in the bottom 50\% of journals with those publishing in higher-ranked journals.
%            %      This comparison aims to understand the differences in citation patterns and the implications for using
%            %      citation network analysis in evaluating research impact.
%      \item \textbf{Provide Practical Recommendations:} Offer practical recommendations for academic institutions,
%            funding agencies, and researchers. These recommendations will focus on the use of H-Indexes and the importance of
%            considering journal quality in research evaluations, aiming to promote more equitable and accurate assessments of scholarly impact.
