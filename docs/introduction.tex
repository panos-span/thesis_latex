\section{Background and Motivation}
In the realm of academic research, evaluating the impact and contribution of
scholars is pivotal for numerous purposes, including tenure decisions, grant
allocations, and academic promotions. One of the most widely used metrics for
this evaluation is the H-Index, which aims to measure both the productivity and
citation impact of a scholar’s publications. Despite its widespread adoption,
the H-Index has been critiqued for several limitations, particularly its
susceptibility to inflation through the inclusion of lower-quality publications
\cite{costas2007h, tonta2020monetary}.

According to Hirsch, a scientist has an index \( h \) if \( h \) of his or her
\( N_p \) papers have at least \( h \) citations each, and the other \( (N_p -
h) \) papers have \(\leq h \) citations each.

\[
      \text{H-Index} = \max \left( h : \text{there are at least } h \text{ papers with } h \text{ or more citations each} \right)
\]

Formally, for a given researcher with \( N_p \) papers, the H-Index \( h \) is
defined as:

\[
      h = \max \left\{ h \, \Bigg| \, \sum_{i=1}^{N_p} \mathbf{1} (c_i \geq h) \geq h \right\}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
      \item \( N_p \) is the total number of papers,
      \item \( c_i \) is the number of citations for the \( i \)-th paper,
      \item \( \mathbf{1}(\cdot) \) is the indicator function, which is 1 if the condition inside is true and 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize} In simpler terms, the H-Index is defined as the maximum value of h
such that the given author has published h papers that have each been cited at least h times \cite{hirsch2005index}.
While straightforward, this metric does not account for the quality of the journals where
these papers are published. Consequently, an author could achieve a high H-Index
by publishing numerous papers in lower-impact journals, potentially inflating their perceived achievements \cite{tonta2020monetary}.

This inflation problem becomes particularly problematic in interdisciplinary
fields where the impact and quality of journals can vary significantly across
different subjects \cite{hirsch2005index,waltman2012inconsistency}. Therefore,
there is a pressing need to refine the H-Index by incorporating metrics that
reflect journal quality and subject specificity. Addressing these limitations
could enhance the accuracy and fairness of academic evaluations, ensuring that
the metric truly reflects the influence of researchers.

\section{Problem Statement}
The phenomenon of inflation of the h-index is a concern of high importance in
contemporary scientific metrics, particularly driven by the rise of
hyperauthorship. It refers to the artificial boosting of a scholar's h-index
through various practices such as self-citation, extensive co-authorship, and
the use of certain databases, which arises from the consistent growth of
scientific publications and citations over time. The primary reason behind this
is that more recent publications have access to a larger pool of potential
citations, thereby increasing their citation counts more rapidly
\cite{norris2010h, koltun2021h, bi2023four}. Database choice also plays a role
in h-index inflation due to varying coverage of publications and citations.
Jacso highlighted the variability in h-index scores depending on the database
used (Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science), noting that databases like
Google Scholar tend to have higher citation counts due to their broader and
less selective indexing practices, and Meho and Yang found that combining
citation counts from multiple databases (Scopus and Web of Science) resulted in
a higher overall citation count, which could inflate h-index scores
\cite{norris2010h}.

Crucial to acknowledge is that, a highly important aspect of the H-Index
inflation is the lack of consideration of the quality of the journals in which
the publications are published. Without taking into account their prestige and
quality of the journals, the H-Index can be artificially boosted by
publications in lower-quality journals, that may not have rigorous peer-review
processes. Specifically, researchers might target those with lower standards,
which can increase the number of published papers and citations without
corresponding increases in the quality of research. This inflation can distort
the assessment of academic influence and undermine the credibility of
bibliometric evaluations \cite{tonta2020monetary}.

Additionally, the h-index inflation can also drive unethical practices like
gift authorship, where individuals add each other’s names to publications with
minimal or no contribution to artificially boost their h-index
\cite{bi2023four}. Finally, the failure to convert nominal citation values into
real citation values, which are adjusted for the growth of scientific output,
results in mismeasurement of scientific contribution which particularly affects the
evaluation of the career impact of researchers who started their careers at
different times, since researchers from earlier generations are likely to have
their achievements underestimated if their citation counts are not adjusted for
inflation \cite{petersen2019methods}.

\section{Research Questions and Hypotheses}
This thesis, by introducing a new metric that incorporates journal quality into
the calculation of the H-Index, with different ways of ranking journals based
on their quality, aims to address the limitations of the H-Index and provide a
more accurate and meaningful assessment of a researcher's scholarly impact. As
such, the following research questions are posed: First, what is the
correlation between traditional H-Index values and the proposed H-Index metrics
that account for journal quality and what does that mean for the assessment of
authors? Second, how do citation practices differ between top authors
publishing in low-quality journals and authors publishing in high-quality
journals? Third, how do citation patterns differ between hyperprolific and
regular researchers across different subject areas? By addressing these
research questions, this thesis seeks not only to develop and validate improved
H-Index calculations that incorporate journal quality, but to also provide
insights into the citation practices and patterns of researchers across
different subjects, thus contributing to a more complete understanding of
academic contributions.
